Polymer countdown element
=========================
This is a countdown element to gather some experience with Polymer

Use it like this:
```html
<my-countdown end-date="2015-08-20T18:00:00+0200"></my-countdown>
```

What even...?
-------------
1. ~~For some reason, `countdown` is not a valid name for elements but `my-countdown` is~~. [Apparently custom elements are *required* to have a dash in their name. Okay... ](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/quick-tour.html#register)
2. ~~I would like to name the attribute `end-date` instead of `endDate` but I don't know how~~. Fixed in Polymer 1.0!



Oh by the way, there's a non-Polymer Codepen version: http://codepen.io/Retzudo/pen/KwLLKg
